Unofficial, Python-based game engine and rules framework inspired by *Quacksalber von Quedlinburg*.

== Project goals

This project aims to provide a *clean, explicit, and testable* implementation of a Quacks-style board game engine.

Key objectives:

* Model the full game loop (rounds, phases, events) in a structured way
* Centralize and make game state explicit and auditable
* Replace hard-coded branching logic with dispatch- and table-driven rules
* Enable incremental implementation of event cards, chips, and expansions
* Provide developer-friendly console output for debugging and verification

Non-goals (for now):

* Graphical user interface
* Online or networked multiplayer
* Complete coverage of all expansions and edge rules

Correctness, clarity, and maintainability take precedence over feature completeness.

== Current status

* ✔ Round and phase framework in place
* ✔ Central player and game state handling
* ✔ Event card data model
* ✔ Ongoing refactor from hard-coded logic toward dispatch tables
* ⏳ Rule coverage is partial and expanding incrementally

The project is under *active development* and may change structure as rules are clarified.

== Requirements

* Python 3.11 or newer is recommended
* No heavy external dependencies are required at this stage

== Running the game

Basic usage (entry point may evolve during development):

[source,bash]
----
python main.py

Consult inline comments and recent commits for the most up-to-date execution flow.

Module names and responsibilities are intentionally explicit.  
State mutations are centralized and should not be hidden behind implicit side effects.
